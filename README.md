# API Route responding with 500

## Description

On each folder there is a separate project crated with `npx create-next-app@latest` (using page router) and each one with different versions of `@module-federation/nextjs-mf`, with webpack and plugins configured propperly

This repo is to demostrate the error happening after the version `8.1.4` of the `@module-federation/nextjs-mf` dependency

## Steps to run this example

On each folder run:

`npm install`

and then 

`npm run build && npm run start`

Try reaching the route `localhost:3000/api/hello`

On the project with `@module-federation/nextjs-mf` version `8.1.3` it works as expected, but on the repo with `@module-federation/nextjs-mf` version `8.1.4` it returns a `500` as response with an html reponse type, executing the `_app` and `_document` files.

The error on the console is something like:
``` 
 тип TypeError: o.setGlobalFederationConstructor is not a function
